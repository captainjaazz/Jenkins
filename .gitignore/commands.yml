  - name: explanation of commands
    curl: This is a command-line tool for making network requests. In this context, it's used to download a file from a URL
    -fsSL: These are options passed to the curl command:
    -f: Fail silently (i.e., don't show error messages).
    -s: Silent mode (don't show progress or error messages).
    -S: Show errors if they occur.
    -L: Follow redirects (if the URL responds with a redirect, curl will follow it to the final destination).
    -|: This is a pipe symbol. It's used to pass the output of the curl command to the next command in the pipeline. |
    URL from which curl it's downloading a GPG (GNU Privacy Guard) key from the Jenkins repository
    -sudo: to run the tee command with elevated privileges. tee is a command that reads from standard input and writes to one or more files.
  
  - name: next line
    - deb: indicates that this is a Debian package repository. |
    So, when you run this command, you're essentially creating a configuration file (jenkins.list) in the /etc/apt/sources.list.d/ directory | 
    that specifies the Jenkins package repository and its associated GPG key for package verification.
